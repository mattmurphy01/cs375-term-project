In this project, we analyzed, implemented, and compared two algorithms that solve the shortest paths problem: the Bellman-Ford algorithm and the A* Shortest Path algorithm. Specifically, we looked at the single-source sing destination variation to determine which of the two algorithms is more efficient in finding the shortest distance from a single source node to another node in the graph.
